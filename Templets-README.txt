Templets - A plugin for making Template Sets pluggable

= Overview =

Templets plugin realizes "pluggable template sets" called "templet",
and allows you to install and manange new templates very
straightforwardly and flexibly.  It makes very easy:

 * For users to customize their base template sets by plugging in
   various kinds of templets, such as iPhone/cellphone templet, widget
   template library templet, and ActionStreams templet if available.

 * For template designers to package and distribute their own
   templates.

 * For plugin developers to package and distribute sample templates
   that use newly implemented template tags, into their plugins.

Until now, installing and updating templates have been a bothersome
task with a lot of cut-and-paste.  But from now, Templets provides a
"turn-key" solution to install any templates into your blogs.
